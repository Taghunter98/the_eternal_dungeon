You stand before the ancient gates of the Eternal Dungeon, a place shrouded in legend and fear.
The air is thick with the scent of damp stone and faint whispers that seem to echo from the depths below.

It is said that no adventurer who has entered this dungeon has ever returned to tell the tale.
Within its labyrinthine corridors lie untold treasures, cunning traps, and creatures that defy imagination.

As you grip your weapon and steady your resolve, a chilling wind escapes from the crack in the gates.
Will you rise as a hero, conquer the shadows within, and uncover the dungeonâ€™s secrets? 

Steel yourself, adventurer. The Eternal Dungeon awaits. Your journey begins now.
"""
bridge_encounter = """
You arrive at the edge of a wide, rushing river. A weathered stone bridge spans the distance, its surface slick with moss.
The water below churns violently, a stark reminder of its strength and depth. The bridge looks old but sturdy, though you can't help but notice the faint cracks along its edges.

You have two choices:
1. Cross the bridge and trust that it will hold your weight.
2. Brave the freezing waters and attempt to swim across.

Both paths hold risks. What will you do?
