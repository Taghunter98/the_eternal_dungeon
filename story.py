level_1_intro = """
You stand before the ancient gates of the Eternal Dungeon, a place shrouded in 
legend and fear. The air is thick with the scent of damp stone and faint whispers 
that seem to echo from the depths below.

It is said that no adventurer who has entered this dungeon has ever returned to 
tell the tale. Within its labyrinthine corridors lie untold treasures, cunning traps, 
and creatures that defy imagination.

As you grip your weapon and steady your resolve, a chilling wind escapes from 
the crack in the gates. Will you rise as a hero, conquer the shadows within, and 
uncover the dungeon’s secrets?

Steel yourself, adventurer. The Eternal Dungeon awaits. Your journey begins now.
"""

dungeon_door = """
You step cautiously toward the ancient stone archway, its towering doors shrouded 
in shadow. The air grows colder, and an eerie silence blankets the area.

Before you stands a massive iron-bound wooden door, its surface etched with 
intricate runes that faintly glow blue in the dim light. A heavy lock secures the 
door, its mechanism rusted but unyielding.

You notice a keyhole at the center of the lock, the shape oddly familiar. A sense 
of recognition washes over you—could this be for the Dungeon Key you were entrusted with?
"""

dungeon_door_success = """
You retrieve the Dungeon Key from your pouch, its weight reassuring in your 
hand. The key slides into the lock with a satisfying click. The runes on the door 
flare brightly before dimming to a soft glow.

With a deep groan, the ancient mechanisms creak to life. The heavy door slowly 
swings open, revealing a dark passage beyond. The faint smell of damp stone and 
the distant echo of dripping water greet you as you take your first step into the 
Eternal Dungeon.
"""

dungeon_door_failure = """
You reach into your pouch, but your fingers find nothing useful. The lock 
remains immovable, and the runes seem to pulse mockingly at your failure.

The dungeon's entrance looms before you, unyielding. Perhaps there’s another 
way to open it—or perhaps you’ve missed something crucial.
"""

bridge_encounter = """
You arrive at the edge of a wide, rushing river. A weathered stone bridge spans 
the distance, its surface slick with moss. The water below churns violently, a 
stark reminder of its strength and depth. The bridge looks old but sturdy, though 
you can't help but notice the faint cracks along its edges.

You have two choices:
1. Cross the bridge and trust that it will hold your weight.
2. Brave the freezing waters and attempt to swim across.

Both paths hold risks. What will you do?
"""

first_battle = """
As you venture deeper into the Eternal Dungeon, the air grows heavier, and the 
shadows seem to close in around you. Suddenly, the sound of scuttling claws and 
rasping breaths echoes through the corridor. Emerging from the darkness, three 
figures block your path—twisted creatures with glowing eyes and jagged weapons. 
Their movements are erratic, yet their intent is clear: to strike you down. You grip 
your weapon tightly, heart pounding in your chest. There’s no turning back now. 
You must fight to survive, for only the strong can withstand the terrors of the dungeon.
"""

battle_victory = """
As the last creature falls to the ground with a guttural snarl, silence descends 
upon the corridor. Your breath comes in ragged gasps, and the weight of your 
victory settles in. The faint glow in the creatures’ eyes fades, leaving only their 
motionless forms sprawled across the cold stone floor. You wipe the sweat from 
your brow and steady your weapon, feeling a surge of triumph. Though the battle 
was hard-fought, you know this is only the beginning. The Eternal Dungeon still 
holds countless dangers ahead—but for now, you stand victorious.
