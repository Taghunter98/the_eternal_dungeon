level_1_intro = """
You stand before the ancient gates of the Eternal Dungeon, a place shrouded in legend and fear.
The air is thick with the scent of damp stone and faint whispers that seem to echo from the depths below.

It is said that no adventurer who has entered this dungeon has ever returned to tell the tale.
Within its labyrinthine corridors lie untold treasures, cunning traps, and creatures that defy imagination.

As you grip your weapon and steady your resolve, a chilling wind escapes from the crack in the gates.
Will you rise as a hero, conquer the shadows within, and uncover the dungeon’s secrets? 

Steel yourself, adventurer. The Eternal Dungeon awaits. Your journey begins now.
"""

dungeon_door = """
You step cautiously toward the ancient stone archway, its towering doors shrouded in shadow. The air grows colder, and an eerie silence blankets the area.

Before you stands a massive iron-bound wooden door, its surface etched with intricate runes that faintly glow blue in the dim light. A heavy lock secures the door, its mechanism rusted but unyielding. 

You notice a keyhole at the center of the lock, the shape oddly familiar. A sense of recognition washes over you—could this be for the Dungeon Key you were entrusted with?
"""

dungeon_door_success = """
You retrieve the Dungeon Key from your pouch, its weight reassuring in your hand. The key slides into the lock with a satisfying click. The runes on the door flare brightly before dimming to a soft glow.

With a deep groan, the ancient mechanisms creak to life. The heavy door slowly swings open, revealing a dark passage beyond. The faint smell of damp stone and the distant echo of dripping water greet you as you take your first step into the Eternal Dungeon.
"""

dungeon_door_failure = """
You reach into your pouch, but your fingers find nothing useful. The lock remains immovable, and the runes seem to pulse mockingly at your failure.

The dungeon's entrance looms before you, unyielding. Perhaps there’s another way to open it—or perhaps you’ve missed something crucial.
"""

bridge_encounter = """
You arrive at the edge of a wide, rushing river. A weathered stone bridge spans the distance, its surface slick with moss.
The water below churns violently, a stark reminder of its strength and depth. The bridge looks old but sturdy, though you can't help but notice the faint cracks along its edges.

You have two choices:
1. Cross the bridge and trust that it will hold your weight.
2. Brave the freezing waters and attempt to swim across.

Both paths hold risks. What will you do?
