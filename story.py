level_1_intro = """
You stand before the ancient gates of the Eternal Dungeon, a place shrouded in 
legend and fear. The air is thick with the scent of damp stone and faint whispers 
that seem to echo from the depths below.

It is said that no adventurer who has entered this dungeon has ever returned to 
tell the tale. Within its labyrinthine corridors lie untold treasures, cunning traps, 
and creatures that defy imagination.

As you grip your weapon and steady your resolve, a chilling wind escapes from 
the crack in the gates. Will you rise as a hero, conquer the shadows within, and 
uncover the dungeon’s secrets?

Steel yourself, adventurer. The Eternal Dungeon awaits. Your journey begins now.
"""

dungeon_door = """
You step cautiously toward the ancient stone archway, its towering doors shrouded 
in shadow. The air grows colder, and an eerie silence blankets the area.

Before you stands a massive iron-bound wooden door, its surface etched with 
intricate runes that faintly glow blue in the dim light. A heavy lock secures the 
door, its mechanism rusted but unyielding.

You notice a keyhole at the center of the lock, the shape oddly familiar. A sense 
of recognition washes over you—could this be for the Dungeon Key you were entrusted with?
"""

dungeon_door_success = """
You retrieve the Dungeon Key from your pouch, its weight reassuring in your 
hand. The key slides into the lock with a satisfying click. The runes on the door 
flare brightly before dimming to a soft glow.

With a deep groan, the ancient mechanisms creak to life. The heavy door slowly 
swings open, revealing a dark passage beyond. The faint smell of damp stone and 
the distant echo of dripping water greet you as you take your first step into the 
Eternal Dungeon.
"""

dungeon_door_failure = """
You reach into your pouch, but your fingers find nothing useful. The lock 
remains immovable, and the runes seem to pulse mockingly at your failure.

The dungeon's entrance looms before you, unyielding. Perhaps there’s another 
way to open it—or perhaps you’ve missed something crucial.
"""

bridge_encounter = """
You arrive at the edge of a wide, rushing river. A weathered stone bridge spans 
the distance, its surface slick with moss. The water below churns violently, a 
stark reminder of its strength and depth. The bridge looks old but sturdy, though 
you can't help but notice the faint cracks along its edges.

You have two choices:
1. Cross the bridge and trust that it will hold your weight.
2. Brave the freezing waters and attempt to swim across.

Both paths hold risks. What will you do?
"""

first_battle = """
As you venture deeper into the Eternal Dungeon, the air grows heavier, and the 
shadows seem to close in around you. Suddenly, the sound of scuttling claws and 
rasping breaths echoes through the corridor. Emerging from the darkness, three 
figures block your path—twisted creatures with glowing eyes and jagged weapons. 
Their movements are erratic, yet their intent is clear: to strike you down. You grip 
your weapon tightly, heart pounding in your chest. There’s no turning back now. 
You must fight to survive, for only the strong can withstand the terrors of the dungeon.
"""

battle_victory = """
As the last creature falls to the ground with a guttural snarl, silence descends 
upon the corridor. Your breath comes in ragged gasps, and the weight of your 
victory settles in. The faint glow in the creatures’ eyes fades, leaving only their 
motionless forms sprawled across the cold stone floor. You wipe the sweat from 
your brow and steady your weapon, feeling a surge of triumph. Though the battle 
was hard-fought, you know this is only the beginning. The Eternal Dungeon still 
holds countless dangers ahead—but for now, you stand victorious.
"""

level_2_intro = """
The air grows colder and heavier as you descend deeper into the Eternal Dungeon. 
The faint whispers from above are replaced by an oppressive silence, broken only 
by the occasional drip of water echoing through the stone halls. The walls here 
seem more ancient, etched with cryptic markings that glow faintly, as though they 
watch your every move. 

You grip your weapon tightly, knowing the dangers ahead will be far greater than 
before. These depths are home to deadlier creatures, born of darkness and fury, 
each eager to test your resolve. Yet, with every step forward, you feel the pull of 
something greater—a promise of power, treasure, and secrets long buried. 

Steeling your nerves, you press on. The second level of the Eternal Dungeon awaits, 
and only the brave or the foolish dare to tread here.
"""
troll_boss_intro = """
The ground beneath your feet trembles as a low, guttural growl echoes through the 
chamber. You step cautiously into the vast, dimly lit room, the air thick with the 
stench of rot and damp earth. Before you stands a hulking figure, its towering form 
shrouded in shadow. As it lumbers forward, the torchlight reveals its grotesque features— 
thick, mottled skin, jagged tusks, and eyes that burn with primal fury.

This is no ordinary foe; this is the Troll Warlord, the dungeon’s guardian and a 
merciless predator. In one massive hand, it clutches a gnarled club, its surface slick 
with dried blood. The troll lets out a deafening roar, the sound reverberating off the 
stone walls, as it beats its chest in a challenge.

Your heart races, but there’s no time for hesitation. To survive this encounter, you 
must rely on every ounce of skill and courage you possess. The battle for your life 
has begun.
"""
troll_boss_victory = """
With a final, thunderous crash, the Troll Warlord collapses to the ground, its massive 
form shaking the very foundation of the dungeon. The echoes of its anguished roar fade, 
leaving an eerie silence in their wake. You stand over the defeated beast, breathless 
and battered, yet victorious. 

The troll’s lifeless eyes stare into the void, its once-unyielding strength now reduced 
to nothing. Among its remains, you notice a gleaming chest, hidden beneath the shadows. 
The reward for your courage and skill awaits. 

As you catch your breath, a sense of accomplishment fills you. Against all odds, you 
have triumphed over the dungeon’s mighty guardian. But the Eternal Dungeon is far 
from done with you. Deeper challenges and darker foes lie ahead, calling you forward.
